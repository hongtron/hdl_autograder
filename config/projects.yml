    Intro to Computer Systems :: Project 1 :: Logic Gates

    Grading method: The implementation of some chips was described in the book,
    and some chips are simpler than others. The different weights assigned to
    the chips below reflect this variance.  If the chip passes all the tests
    specified in the supplied test script, it receives two-thirds of its
    allotted points. The remaining third reflects our evaluation of the way the
    chip is built.

    Generally speaking, we prefer implementations that use as few chip parts as
    possible, even if it implies a less efficient chip design.
